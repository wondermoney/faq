# Screener

The financial markets screener is a tool that allows users to screen or filter through a vast database of financial instruments or securities such as stocks, bonds, and mutual funds to find investments that meet specific criteria or metrics. This feature enables users to narrow down their search and focus on investments that align with their investment strategy, risk tolerance, and financial goals.

Using a financial markets screener, users can customize their search by inputting specific filters such as market capitalization, dividend yield, price-to-earnings ratio (P/E ratio), and other fundamental and technical analysis metrics. The screener will then generate a list of securities that meet the user's criteria and display relevant information such as the security's price, performance history, and financial metrics.

The financial markets screener is a valuable tool for investors and traders looking to find opportunities in the financial markets. This feature can help them identify undervalued or overvalued securities, find stocks with high dividend yields or growth potential, and discover companies with strong financials and earnings reports.
