These general terms and conditions govern the provision of the service provided by WonderMoney (hereinafter "Service") through a web application accessible through an internet browser.

Through the Service, Radix Catch LDA provides users with information about accounts and their respective transactions, as well as the aggregation and visualization of data of various natures and applicabilities.

# 1. Disclaimer

Radix Catch LDA is not responsible for any damages, losses or expenses incurred by the user resulting from the use of the software. The service should be perceived as a software for aggregating and visualizing data, not as financial or tax advice.

The user assumes all responsibility and risk for the use of the software and agrees to indemnify Radix Catch LDA from any liability arising from the use of the software.

# 2. Membership

The user may register on the platform without incurring any costs through their email address, and must subscribe to a monthly or annual subscription to access specific features of the Service.

# 3. Access

The user can access their personal area through a secure authentication process using a combination of email address and password, with an additional security method called Two-Factor Authentication also available, or through a social network account (Facebook and Google).

The additional method can be activated at no cost to the user. In case of loss of access to Two-Factor Authentication, the user must contact support@wonder.money to initiate the access restoration process.

A minimum complexity is recommended when defining the password, which will be stored encrypted and inaccessible in a specialized partner. Access is considered personal and non-transferable.

# 4. Account Linking and Data Import

The user can integrate their data in various ways, including:

4.1 Through Open Banking protocols

By using the automatic import method through Application Programming Interface (API) protocols, the user accepts the processing of data through our data processing partner. The user will be informed at all times about the data they will share, and the authorization will be valid for a period of 90 days unless manually removed by the user.

**The Service will never request access to initiate payments and transfers, limiting itself only to reading and importing bank data.**

4.2 Manually

The user can enter data manually in different modules or resort to importing csv and xls files, with this functionality being limited to structured data prepared to be received by the platform.

# 5. Privacy and Personal Data Protection

5.1 Radix Catch LDA guarantees the confidentiality of all data provided by users.

5.2 Personal data submitted in the use of the Service is essential to its provision. The omission or inaccuracy of data provided by the user is their sole and entire responsibility and may result in the refusal to provide the Service by Radix Catch LDA.

5.3 The user's personal data will be processed and stored electronically and are intended to be used by Radix Catch LDA in the context of the contractual and/or commercial relationship with the user, and may be shared with partners for commercial purposes, but ensuring their privacy and anonymity.

5.4 Under applicable law, the user is guaranteed, at no additional cost, the right of access, rectification, and updating of their personal data, directly or by written request, as well as the right to object to their use for the purposes set out in the preceding paragraph, and for this purpose, the user must contact the entity responsible for processing personal data via email at support@wonder.money.

# 6. Subscription to Service

After the trial period, the user will have the option to subscribe to a plan to have continued access to the Service.

6.1 Duration and Price

The plan's duration may be monthly or annual, subject to the applicable price at the time of subscription. The plan will be automatically renewed, unless canceled as described in point 6.2. The user may also use a discount or referral coupon, subject to additional terms to access the additional discount.

6.2 Change and cancellation of subscription

The plan may be changed to an alternative, provided that it is of longer duration.

The monthly plan's renewal may be canceled at any time, taking effect at the end of the current monthly cycle. In the case of the annual plan, the user will have 30 days to cancel the subscription without any justification, with the refund of the equivalent of 91.6% of the amount paid. After the initial 30 days, the user may cancel the renewal of their annual subscription, which will take effect after the end of the current cycle.

# 7. Changes to Terms and Conditions

Radix Catch LDA reserves the right to modify these terms and conditions at any time, with the user being informed in advance by email. The user agrees to comply with the most recent versions of these terms and acknowledges that the continued use of the Service after the modification of the terms and conditions is an implicit acceptance of these changes.
