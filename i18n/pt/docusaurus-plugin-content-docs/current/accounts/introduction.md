# Accounts

An account is an entity that has a balance and transactions. This is most commonly used to represent a bank account.

## Account Types

There are two types of accounts:

- Linked: A linked account is an account that is linked to a bank account. This is the recommended way to create an account.
- Unlinked: An unlinked account is an account that is manually created and does not have a bank account linked to it.
