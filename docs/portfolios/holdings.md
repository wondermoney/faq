# Holdings

The holdings feature displays a summary of the individual's portfolio, listing each asset and its corresponding allocation percentage. It also shows the realized and unrealized gains and losses for each asset, indicating whether the investment has generated a profit or a loss. The current value of each asset is displayed alongside the allocation percentage, allowing investors to see the impact of price movements on their portfolio's overall value.

It enables investors to identify which assets are driving returns and which may require adjustment to better align with their investment strategy and financial goals. This feature is especially useful for those who hold multiple securities or asset classes within their portfolio and need to track their investments in a centralized location.

At this moment, we only support the **FIFO** method.
