# Import transaction

We support multiple ways to import transactions:

- Automatic import from your bank
- Manual import from CSV files

## Automatic import from your bank

When you add a "linked" account, we will automatically import all your transactions from your bank account. This is the recommended way to import transactions.
After the first import, we will automatically import all your transactions as soon as they are available in your bank account.

## Manual import from CSV files

You can manually import transactions from CSV files. This is useful if you want to import transactions from a bank that is not supported by our automatic import, or if you don't want to link your bank account to our platform.

:::info Limited Support

We currently only support CSV files from the following banks: ActivoBank, Bankinter, BCP, BPI and Montepio.
